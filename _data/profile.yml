  <p>
    I am currently a 4th year Masters of Engineering Discrete Mathematics student at the University of Warwick. 
    I find particularly enjoyable the process of applying my knowledge of algorithms and mathematics to solve deep and fascinating problems,
    creating something new and unexplored, and collaborating with a team to discover something amazing!
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a broad interest in all of:
    <ul>
      <li>Automata and formal languages</li>
      <li>Logic and games</li>
      <li>Computational complexity</li>
      <li>Discrete mathematics</li>
      <li>Axiomatic set theory</li>
      <li>Theoretical machine learning</li>
    <\ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently looking for a PhD position within these interests, so if you are interested in supervising such a project, email me.
